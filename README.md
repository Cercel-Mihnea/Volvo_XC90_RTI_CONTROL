## Code Functions: 
- changing screen mode (rgb, pal, ntsc, off)
- changing brightness
- changing screen modes and brightness via OE remote
- changing screen modes and brightness via Serial USB commands
- saving last states to EEPROM

## How to use the remote?
<ul>
    <li><strong>up</strong> - on (ntsc)</li>
    <li><strong>down</strong> - off</li>
    <li><strong>left</strong> - dim the screen</li>
    <li><strong>right</strong> - brighten the screen</li>
    <li><strong>enter</strong> - brightness hotkey (by default full)</li>
    <li><strong>back</strong> - brightness hotkey (by default 20%)</li>
</ul> 

## Parts, tools, skills needed
- arduino (It doesn't really matter which arduino you choose. It doesn't have to be original either. I recommend the cheapest arduino/seeeduino nano you can find.)
- RCA plug (can be with screws for easier installation) or rca cable you can cut and solder
- some dupont wires (standart cables) 
- plastic case or isolation tape to protect arduino and your car from damage
- USB to AV adapter - I know adapters on processor family MS91XX works 
- (optional) arduino screw shield (its easier to connect cables)
- (optional but recommended) soldering iron - it's bteer to solder wires to make connection stronger. Remember - this is analog video signal and can be easly distorted.
